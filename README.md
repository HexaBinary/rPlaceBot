# rPlaceBot

rPlaceBot is a Discord bot made to help Discord communities create art in Reddit's r/Place canvas

Currently a WIP

**These changes are necessary to make in the config file in a local setup for the bot to work**

=> change the guild id to your servers' id
=> change the client id to your bots'
=> crate a file named .env including your bot's token in "BOT_TOKEN=*your-token*" format
