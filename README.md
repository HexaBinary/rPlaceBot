# rPlaceBot

rPlaceBot is a Discord bot made to help Discord communities create art in Reddit's r/Place canvas

Discontinued development due to lack of js experience and the end of r/place 2022 getting near, may continue if r/place becomes annual

**These changes are necessary to make in the config file in a local setup for the bot to work**

=> change the client id to your bots'

=> crate a file named .env including your bot's token in "BOT_TOKEN=*your-token*" format

=> put your pixel arts' filepath to the img field in config.

=> put the top left corner coordinates for your planned pixel art in the startX & startY fields in config
